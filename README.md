# swaylock-effects

Swaylock-effects is a fork of [swaylock](https://github.com/swaywm/swaylock)
which adds built-in screenshots and image manipulation effects like blurring.
It's inspired by [i3lock-color](https://github.com/PandorasFox/i3lock-color),
although the feature sets aren't perfectly overlapping.

## Example Command

## New Features

The main new features compared to upstream swaylock are:

* `--screenshots` to use screenshots instead of an image on disk or a color
* `--clock` to show date/time in the indicator
	* Use `--indicator` to make the indicator always active
	* Use `--timestr` and `--datestr` to set the date/time formats
	  (using strftime-style formatting)
* `--submit-on-touch` to use your touchscreen to submit a password.
  If you can unlock your device with anything else than your password,
  this might come helpful to trigger PAM's authentication process.
* `--grace <seconds>` to set a password grace period, so that the password
  isn't required to unlock until some number of seconds have passed.
	* Used together with `--indicator`, the indicator is always shown,
	  even in the grace period.
	* Used together with `--indicator-idle-visible`, the indicator is only
	  visible after the grace period.
	* By default, a key press, a mouse event or a touch event will unlock
	  during the grace period. Use `--grace-no-mouse` to not unlock as a response
	  to a mouse event, and `--grace-no-touch` to not unlock as a response to
	  a touch event.
* `--fade-in <seconds>` to make the lock screen fade in.
* Various effects which can be applied to the background image
	* `--effect-blur <radius>x<times>`: Blur the image (thanks to yvbbrjdr's
	  fast box blur algorithm in
	  [i3lock-fancy-rapid](https://github.com/yvbbrjdr/i3lock-fancy-rapid))
	* `--effect-pixelate <factor>`: Pixelate the image.
	* `--effect-scale <scale>`: Scale the image by a factor. This can be used
	  to make other effects faster if you don't need the full resolution.
	* `--effect-greyscale`: Make the image greyscale.
	* `--effect-vignette <base>:<factor>`: Apply a vignette effect (range is 0-1).
	* `--effect-compose <position>;<size>;<gravity>;<path>`: Overlay another image.
	* `--effect-custom <path>`: Load a custom effect from a C file or shared object.

New feature ideas are welcome as issues (though I may never get around to
implement them), new feature implementations are welcome as pull requests :)

## Installation

### From Packages

* Alpine Linux: [swaylock-effects](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=swaylock-effects)
* Arch Linux (AUR): [swaylock-effects-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/swaylock-effects-git/)
* Fedora (Copr): [swaylock-effects](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/eddsalkield/swaylock-effects/)
  (thanks to Edd Salkield)
* FreeBSD: [swaylock-effects](https://www.freshports.org/x11/swaylock-effects/)
* Gentoo (GURU overlay): [swaylock-effects](https://gpo.zugaina.org/Overlays/guru/gui-apps/swaylock-effects)
* T2 SDE: [swaylock-effects](https://t2sde.org/packages/swaylock-effects)

### Compiling from Source

Install dependencies:

* meson \*
* wayland
* wayland-protocols \*
* libxkbcommon
* cairo
* gdk-pixbuf2 \*\*
* pam (optional)
* [scdoc](https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/scdoc) (optional: man pages) \*
* git \*
* openmp (if using a compiler other than GCC)

_\*Compile-time dep_

_\*\*Optional: required for background images other than PNG_

Run these commands:

	meson build
	ninja -C build
	sudo ninja -C build install

On systems without PAM, you need to suid the swaylock binary:

	sudo chmod a+s /usr/local/bin/swaylock

Swaylock will drop root permissions shortly after startup.

## Effects

### Blur

`--effect-blur <radius>x<times>`: Blur the image.

`<radius>` is a number specifying how big
the blur is, `<times>` is a number which specifies essentially how high quality the blur is
(i.e how closely the effect will resemble a true gaussian blur).

### Pixelate

`--effect-pixelate <factor>`: Pixelate the image.

`<factor>` is the amount of pixelation; a value of 10 will make each 10x10 square of pixels
the same color.

### Scale

`--effect-scale <scale>`: Scale the image by a factor.

This effect scales the internal buffer. This has a few uses:

* Use `--effect-scale` in combination with `--scaling` to create a zoom effect:
  `--efect-scale 1.1 --scaling center`
* Speed up other effects by making the resolution smaller: with
  `--effect-scale 0.5 --effect-blur 7x5 --effect-scale 2`, swaylock-effect needs to blur
  only 1/4 as many pixels.

### Greyscale

`--effect-greyscale`: Make the displayed image greyscale.

### Vignette

`--effect-vignette <base>:<factor>`: Apply a vignette effect.
Base and factor should be between 0 and 1.

### Compose

`--effect-compose "<position>;<size>;<gravity>;<path>"`: Overlay another image to your lock screen.

* `<position>`: Optional. The position on the screen to put the image, as `<x>,<y>`.
	* Can be a percentage (`10%,10%`), a number of pixels (`20,20`), or a mix (`30%,40`).
	* A negative number indicates that number of pixels away from the right/bottom instead of
	  from the top/left; `-1,-1` would be the bottom right pixel.
	* Default: `50%,50%`.
* `<size>`: Optional. The size of the image on the screen, as `<w>x<h>`.
	* Can be a percentage (`10%x10%`), a number of pixels (`20x20`), or a mix (`30%x40`).
	* If the width is `-1`, the width is figured out based on the height and aspect ratio.
	* If the height is `-1`, the height is figured out based on the width and aspect ratio.
	* Default: The size of the image file.
* `<gravity>`: Optional. Determine which point of the image is placed at `<position>`.
	* Possible values: `center`, `north`, `south`, `west`, `east`,
	  `northwest`, `northeast`, southwest`, `southeast`.
	* With a `<gravity>` of `northwest`, `<position>` gives the location of the top/left
	  corner of the image; with `southeast`, `<position>` controls the bottom/right corner,
	  `center` controls the middle of the image, etc.
	* Default: `center` if no `<position>` is given; otherwise, intelligently decide a gravity
	  based on position (`10,10` -> northwest, `-10,10` -> northeast, etc).
* `<path>`: The path to an image file.

This command requires swaylock-effects to be compiled with gdk-pixbuf2.
It supports all image formats gdk-pixbuf2 supports; on my system, that's
png, jpeg, gif, svg, bmp, ico, tiff, wmf, ani, icns, pnm, qtif, tga, xbm and xpm.

### Custom

`--effect-custom <path>`: Load a custom effect from a shared object.

The .so must export a function `void swaylock_effect(uint32_t *data, int width, int height)`
or a function `uint32_t swaylock_pixel(uint32_t pix, int x, int y, int width, int height)`.
